# Contributing

Flask-Talisman loves help from anyone in the community. You can do so in the following steps:

- Fork the repository.
- Write your contribution. Don't forget to add tests!
- Run tests and linting locally by running `nox` in the root of the project.
- If everything passes, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/wntrblm/flask-talisman/compare/).

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within a few days.
